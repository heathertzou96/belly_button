# Belly Button Project

## Background
An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Task
* Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
* Deploy page on GitHub pages.
